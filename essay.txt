This should run correctly in a computer with a standard course software
installed (python3, django, etc). See the course page:
https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/installation-guide
When using manage.py, it must be invoked with python3.
The database in its original state is saved to db.sqlite3.original .

FLAW 1:
Injection on search page
Use variable binding and filter the input received from user.

FLAW 2:
Broken authenticaton everywhere
Session id is the same than user id, which is easily guessable.
Use proper session managenent framework instead of homebrewn one.

FLAW 3:
Insufficient logging & monitoring
No provisions made to log anything.
Needs to log at least the authentication and transactions.

FLAW 4:
Broken access control
Using special undocumented parameter, user can bypass restrictions on
his/hers money transfers.
Corrected by removing the magic parameter. If such a functionality is needed,
implement appropriate rights to special accounts.

FLAW 5:
Sensitive data exposure
By leveraging flaws 1, 2, or 4 above, user can see any information
stored in system, or, indeed, modify any data in any way.
Also, passwords are stored unencrypted in the database.
Corrected by fixing the above flaws and encrypting and salting the passwords
properly.
